## Installation

Copying the files from GitHub to your machine and then invoking it from the command line.

## Usage

You will need to initiate it from the command line using "node index" or "node index.js". It will then ask a series of questions for a manager(which is required) and then will give the option to also enter information for an engineer or an intern. Once you have added the amount of employees you would like, you will then choose the option to finish the project and it will generate the HTML. You can check out the HTML in your browser!
